Welcome to the CashuMints Telegram Bot! Here's how to get started:

1. **Using the Bot in Private Chat:**
   - Send me a Cashu token, and Iâ€™ll provide you with a QR code and the status of the token.

2. **Using the Bot in Group Chats:**
   - Add me to a group and give me admin permissions with only the 'Remove Messages' permission enabled.
   - I only need this permission to remove Cashu tokens after processing them to keep the chat clean and tidy.

Happy Satoshi hunting!
